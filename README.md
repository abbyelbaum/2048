2048 README

Program: 2048
By: Ally Geren and Abby Elbaum

How To:
Our code is a 2048 game. In 2048, a player starts with two tiles, and moves those tiles either left, right, up, or down. Each time the player moves, a new tile appears at a random location on the board. If two tiles with the same numerical value touch, they merge and create one tile with double that value. The tiles start out at a value of 2 or 4 and the goal of the game is to create a 2048 tile.
